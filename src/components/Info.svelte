    The <a href="https://theodi.org/article/data-ethics-canvas/" target="_blank">ODI Data Ethics Canvas</a>
    is a tool for anyone who collects, shares or uses data. It helps identify and manage ethical issues –
    at the start of a project that uses data, and throughout. It encourages you to ask important questions
    about projects that use data, and reflect on the responses. These might be:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>What is your primary purpose for using data in this project?</li>
    <li>Who could be negatively affected by this project?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The Data Ethics Canvas provides a framework to develop ethical guidance that suits any context, whatever
    the project’s size or scope.
